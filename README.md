**IMPORTANT**: Use the [NES 2.0 XML Database](https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19940&p=248796) [(mirror)](https://github.com/SmokeMonsterPacks/Nt-Mini-Noir-Jailbreak/raw/main/nes20db.7z) and the [NES Header Repair Tool Python Script](https://github.com/Kitrinx/NES_Header_Repair) to fix your NES rom headers!

It is recommended to have less than 800 files per subdirectory.

-------------------

# Updating Firmware

## Step 1: Flashing the Firmware

Format a 2GB (or larger) SD card as
[FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAT32) (FAT16 and exFAT are not
supported). In Windows, you must use a tool for cards larger than
32GB, such as
[fat32format](https://fat32-format.en.softonic.com/).

Copy
[ntmv2_firmware_verJB6.6.bin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmokeMonsterPacks/Nt-Mini-Noir-Jailbreak/main/firmware/ntmv2_firmware_verJB6.6.bin)
into the root directory of your SD card.  Be sure that there is only
one firmware file there.  Insert the card into your Nt Mini Noir and
power on. The firmware will be flashed to the console. This process
may take three or more minutes.

While the firmware is flashing the LED will flash, followed by a
considerable pause and HDMI signal blackout.  Do not power off.  The
system will reboot automatically when it has finished.  Delete the
firmware file from your card after flashing.  The main menu will
present a new option, `Cores`, to signify it is Jailbreak mode.

The Nt Mini Noir is protected from bricking as a result of firmware
updates, but follow the above precautions to be safe. If need be you
can always reinstall the [official
firmware](https://support.analogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/360052916371-Nt-mini-Noir-Firmware-Update-v1-0). If
you encounter difficulties, make sure you are following the steps
described
[here](https://github.com/SmokeMonsterPacks/Nt-Mini-Noir-Jailbreak/issues/10).


## Step 2: System Setup

Unzip [SD Card System
Structure\_verJB6.6.zip](https://github.com/SmokeMonsterPacks/Nt-Mini-Noir-Jailbreak/raw/main/firmware/SD%20Card%20System%20Structure_verJB6.6.zip)
and move all the content from the unzipped folder into the root directory of your SD card. You will now have a set of
folders reflecting where game ROMs should be stored. Follow the
instructions below for configuring the `/BIOS/` folder.


## How to launch a core?

The cores menu lets you select one of the various cores that are and
will be available.  To run a specific core (say, NES) simply select
it.  If the core needs to be loaded, a box will pop up asking you if
you wish to load it.  The loading takes approximately 4 seconds.

During the core loading, the front LED will flicker rapidly to
indicate it is loading.  While this happens, the monitor will show no
signal, since the FPGA is being reconfigured at this time.  After the
loading, the monitor will come back and you will be sitting in the
file browser for this particular core.

The key setup for the core menus are:

- `UP`/`DOWN`: select a file
- `LEFT`/`RIGHT`: page through the files quickly 16 at a time
- `B`: pressing once will take you to the top of the file list.
  pressing again takes you to the bottom.
- `A`: run the game.
- `START`: enter the settings menu. This is slightly different from
  the main menu.  There may be a `Core Options` settings menu.
  Everything core specific will be found here.
- `SELECT`: exit the menu. You will be asked to confirm.  If you
  confirm, it returns to the core select menu.  If you do not wish to
  exit, it returns to the currently running game.

v6.1 (initial release)


------------------------------

# NES/Famicom Core Release Notes

This core is extremely large and encompasses 279 mappers.  All the
major mappers and many other mappers are implemented and work.  NES
2.0 headers are 100% supported and many NES 2.0 mappers are included.
Every mapper was completely rewritten using the most current
information available.


## save games

Save game RAM is fully supported for many mappers, and has three modes:
- always save
- never save
- prompt

This allows you to control how save RAM saving works. Save filenames
should be usable out to 256 characters or so now, which should
encompass just about anything.

EEPROM and Flash saving are not supported.  EEPROM saving is used by
some [Mapper 16](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_016),
[Mapper 157](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_157) and
all [Mapper 159](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_159)
games (Bandai releases and Datach Joint ROM System).  Flash saving is
used by [Mappers 30](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/UNROM_512)
and [111](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/GTROM) (homebrew
releases).


## Expansion audio

Expansion cartridge audio is supported.  Unlike cart mode, however,
the act of loading a ROM will force the proper expansion chip to be
selected.  This includes many pirate conversions of FDS games to
cartridge (except for *Tobadaise Daisuken*, which had its FDS audio
data removed.)

## Family BASIC Keyboard

Enable Passthrough Mode to use the keyboard.

## other features

Nt Mini Noir supports NES ROMs up to 16MiB in size with up to 32KiB of
CHR-RAM and 64KiB of PRG-RAM.  So you cannot have a 16MiB PRG-ROM with
64KiB of CHR-RAM, for example.

Some mappers ([mapper
90](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/J.Y._Company_ASIC), multicart
mappers, drip mapper) support dip switches.  These can be found under
the `Core Options` menu which is accessed by hitting `START` on the
file browser for the NES core.

Each time a game is loaded, the dipswitches will be cleared.

For the *Nintendo World Championships 1990* and *Nintendo Campus
Challenge 1991* competition cartridges, Dips 1-4 set the competition
time and Dip 5 removes the time limit.  Here are the settings for Dips
1-4:

```
O = switch open ("off")
C = switch closed ("on")
```
| Dips 4321 | time (mins)                       |
| --------- | -----------                       |
| `OOOO`    | 5.001                             |
| `OOOC`    | 5.316                             |
| `OOCO`    | 5.629                             |
| `OOCC`    | 5.942                             |
| `OCOO`    | 6.254 (Official Tournament Times) |
| `OCOC`    | 6.567                             |
| `OCCO`    | 6.880                             |
| `OCCC`    | 7.193                             |
| `COOO`    | 7.505                             |
| `COOC`    | 7.818                             |
| `COCO`    | 8.131                             |
| `COCC`    | 8.444                             |
| `CCOO`    | 8.756                             |
| `CCOC`    | 9.070                             |
| `CCCO`    | 9.318                             |
| `CCCC`    | 9.695                             |

Dip Switches always default to Off, so you should set the Dip Switches
and then press Reset.  These games are started by pressing `start` on
the 2nd controller.

Coin insertion is done using the trigger on a 12 button controller,
and can also be done on the dipswitch submenu if this mapper supports.
All Vs. mappers and mapper 126 (arcade board) use this.

Nt Mini Noir's Core Jailbreak has full Vs. System support for any
known game which does not use Vs. Dual System capabilities.  This
means that *Vs. Balloon Fight*, *Vs. Baseball*, *Vs. Ice Climber
Dual*, *Vs. Mahjong*, *Vs. Raid on Bungeling Bay*, *Vs. Tennis* and
*Vs. Wrecking Crew* are not playable, but the rest are playable.

Vs. System games require full NES 2.0 headers to work properly.  Use
the [NES 2.0 XML
Database](https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19940&p=248796)
and the [NES Header Repair Tool Python
Script](https://github.com/Kitrinx/NES_Header_Repair) to fix your
headers.

*Vs. Tetris* has only 24KiB of PRG-ROM but the jailbreak will only
load a ROM with 32KiB of PRG-ROM.  You can add 8,192 padding bytes of
0x00 bytes (or 0xFF bytes) inserted between the header and start of the PRG-ROM to get the
game to work. *Vs. Gumshoe* may also need padding in addition to ROM reordering (see NewRisingSun's [fixes](https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=17213&start=45#p220718)).

Vs. System games obtain their settings from a bank of eight dip
switches, these will be found as Dips 1-8 under Core Options - Dip
Switches.  If you are not using a SNES-style controller, you can Add a
Coin with the Dip Switch menu.

With Vs. System games, you start games with the Select button on
either Controller I or, for a two-player game, Controller II.

Zappers are supported for Vs. games that use a light gun.

Vs. System games that use one of the 2C04 PPUs will show very
incorrect colors when run on a PPU that uses a regular palette (2C02,
2C03, 2C05, 2C07) On Nt Mini Noir the S-Video and Composite video
output options generate palette colors like an original 2C02 or 2C07
would and cannot change their palettes.  The result is that you will
need to use Component, RGB or HDMI video to play these games with the
proper colors.

NewRisingSun has [compiled](https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=17213&start=45#p220718) a helpful set of NES2.0 headers for many Vs. System ROMs and a script that can construct these NES ROMs from MAMEs PRG/CHR ROM dumps.

## problem solving

This core is taking full advantage of NES 2.0 headers.  This includes
mappers, save RAM size, etc.  It is highly recommended that you
upgrade your ROM set.  If some games will not run, it most likely is
because the core needs more information contained in the 2.0 header,
such as *Star Tropics*. *Star Tropics* is actually mapper 4.1 (MMC6).

Some of the Sachen multi-carts also have issues inherent to their
ROMs: *Super Cartridge Ver 1 - 4 in 1 - Honey Peach* has a broken
triangle channel during title screen music, *Super Cartridge Ver 5 - 7
in 1 - Magical Mathematics* is missing its title screen audio and
*Super Cartridge Ver 7 - 4 in 1 - Silver Eagle*'s main character
sprite gets glitchy when shooting.

## CopyNES mini


This lets you dump cartridges and their save RAM (if equipped)
directly to the SD card!  There are many supported mappers.

To dump a game, follow these steps:

- Insert the game in question into the cartridge slot.
- Select `Run Cartridge` to make sure it works and is making good
  contact.
- Enter the Tools menu and select `Copynes mini`.
- Select the mapper that your game uses.  Use the NES 2.0 XML Database
  to find the mapper for your game.
- Hit `B` to start the dump.  Note that it might take awhile (30
  seconds) to determine the size of the ROMs on the cartridge.
- After the game is dumped, you can enter a filename using
  `up`/`down`/`left`/`right`.  If no name is entered, it will save it
  with a filename determined by the sumcheck of the ROM.
- Hitting `B` will save the ROM.

That's it!  You can test the game by going into the cores menu and
selecting `NES`, then going to the `/COPYNES/` directory and running
the ROM.


## FDS

Full FDS disk drive and RAM adapter emulation has been added.  This
allows FDS games to be played that consist of from 1 to 4 disk sides.
The FDS images must be a multiple of 65500 bytes, and cannot contain
headers.

Valid file sizes in bytes:
```
 65500 bytes - 1 disk side
131000 bytes - 2 disk sides (these first two are the most common)
196500 bytes - 3 disk sides (very rare)
262000 bytes - 4 disk sides (somewhat rare)
```

To use the FDS functionality, an FDS BIOS needs to placed into the
`/BIOS/` directory.  Any of the three BIOS dumps can be used: R0, R1,
or the Twin Famicom version.  It must be named `fds.bin`

Several methods to load disks and change sides are provided in a new
menu titled "FDS" that appears on the cores menu only when an FDS game
is loaded.

By default, "automatic" mode is selected.  This mode will
automatically load the first side of the FDS image and run it without
user intervention.  It will also detect the side and disk the game is
attempting to load, and will automatically select the side for you.
The loading prompts are also automatically passed so usually no
intervention is required to play the games.

There are a few exceptions to this, however, and a few games need to
be loaded manually.  These are listed later.

When an FDS game is loaded, a new FDS menu appears on the main menu.
This menu allows full control of the FDS "drive".

In the menu, the auto/manual selection can be made, and a disk
ejected, and/or a new side can be selected.

Saving: When the file menu is opened, the FDS disk data is saved to a
`.sav` file like with cartridge games, however the data is no longer
in .fds format; it is in the expanded disk format with gaps and CRCs.
This is due to the fact that .fds files must be expanded to be loaded.
When loading a game with an existing .sav file, the .sav file will be
loaded and the contents of the .fds will NOT be used, except to
determine the number of disk sides the game contains.

This means if you wish to reload a game from the .fds to play it, its
.sav file must be deleted, or the .fds renamed.  This way the original
file is not modified.

A .sav file will NOT be created unless the contents of the disk were
modified. This means games that do not save to disk will not create
.sav files.

There are three ways to handle disk changing:

Manual mode: You must manually select disks and sides in the menu.
You do not need to eject before changing disks or sides; it wil
perform a 1/4th second eject for you.

Semiautomatic mode functionality: This is the default mode.  Pressing
select will eject the disk as long as select is down, and for about
1/2 second after it is released, and then auto-select the proper disk
and side.

Some games such as *Doki Doki Panic* have an unusually long wait to
check for a disk being ejected so this accommodates that.  Note that
since select ejects the disk, it is not a good idea to do this while a
game is loading since it will throw an error 01.  Usually most games
can recover from this though, and will attempt to load again.  The
same caveats with automatic mode follow over to semiautomatic mode
with regards to a few games not being able to autodetect the
side/disk.  No known games or software have an issue with the disk
being ejected once they have loaded, and only check it when they wish
to load or are actively loading.

Automatic mode functionality: The automatic mode works fine for most
games except those outlined below.  It has a few extra features that
are activated by use of the select button on player 1.  Some games,
such as Zelda, will skip the title screen and directly load the game.
To see the title screen, the select button can be held which will stop
the automatic switching from happening until it is released.

On a few games, it can take a few seconds for the automatic loading
process to start.  This is normal because every game has to read the
state of the disk, and each one does it differently.

A few games that use custom loading routines can produce `ERR 01`
errors If this happens simply hold the select button down during the
loading process.

If a game seems unresponsive or won't autoload the disk, try holding
down select for a second or so and/or tapping it to see if that
unsticks it.

These games cannot be used with auto mode because they have custom
disk routines, or they do not specify the proper side when loading:

- Doremikko - does not specify proper side to load
- Koneko Monogatari - uses custom disk routines and not the BIOS
- Some unlicensed games don't specify the side to load
- Bishoujo Shashinkan - Moving School - reboots unless run in manual
  mode

# Atari 2600 Core Release Notes


The Atari 2600 core currently only supports joystick games.

Atari 2600 games determine the number of scanlines they will use.  In
HDMI mode, the display window for Atari 2600 games is 160 pixels by
239 pixels, which is adequate for most games.  A few games (*Pick and
Pile*, and *Acid Drop*) produce far too many scanlines, the viewport
can be centered so that most of the screen is visible.


## Controller mapping

It is suggested to use a SNES controller or an SNES NTT Data Pad
(NDK10).  If not, the difficulty switches and TV type and Supercharger
load functionality is present in the core options menu.

You can swap joystick ports virtually, because some games seem to use
one or the other.  This is also accessible in the core options menu.

`Y` is the fire button (`B` on an NES controller).

Left and right triggers toggle the difficulty switch for this player,
while on player 1, `X` and `A` toggle the B&W/colour switch.  `X` is
colour, `A` is B&W.

In most games, left trigger is hard, and right trigger is easy.

`Select` and `start` are `select` and `reset`, respectively.


## Core Options menu

You can enable/disable the Atarivox and the controller swap.  A toggle
for the difficulty and TV type switches is present.  An option to load
the next portion of a Supercharger ROM is also here.


## Supercharger games

If you wish to play Supercharger games, you must rename the 2K
Supercharger BIOS ROM to `scbios.bin` (CRC32: `C3A3F073`) and place it
in the `/BIOS/` directory.

When you wish to load a Supercharger game, press both `A` and `X` to
'press play on tape'.  If you have a multiload game, you can press
these again to do the next load when the game calls for it.

Note: it takes about 1-2 seconds for the load to start when the
`A`/`X` combo is pressed or the menu entry selected and pressed.


## Atarivox

Atarivox is supported, via a PIC18F1320.  The PIC ROM code is stored
as `avoxrom.bin` and the PIC EEPROM data is stored as
`avoxee.bin`. `avoxrom.bin` is 8K bytes, and avoxee.bin is 256 bytes.
Place these two files in the `/BIOS/` directory.

Note that the EEPROM is the data on the PIC micro itself, and not the
high score/setting EEPROM. The EEPROM that stores high scores, etc. is
not implemented at this time.


## Supercharger Demo Unit

The demo unit is fully supported.  To run it, you need to make a
single 66K file consisting of the 64K worth of data EPROMs, followed
by the 2K EPROM.


## Palettes

All three palettes are supported: NTSC, PAL, and SECAM.  There is also
an "automatic" mode that will select between NTSC and PAL in most
cases.  It does this by checking the scanline count.  If it's greater
than 284, then the PAL palette is selected, otherwise NTSC is.

You can force a palette to either of the three, or automatic in the
core settings menu.


## Mappers and ROMs

The 2600 has no standardized ROM header format, making it difficult to
determine the identity of any extra hardware on the cartridge.

The 2600 core determines the ROM's mapper based on file size, and then
file extension.

The mapper is determined like so:

| Filesize    | Mapper                                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 2048 bytes  | standard 2K game, no bankswitching                   |
| 4096 bytes  | standard 4K game, no bankswitching                   |
| 8192 bytes  | standard 8K game, uses F8 (FFF8/FFF9) bankswitching  |
| 16384 bytes | standard 16K game, uses F6 (FFF6-FFF9) bankswitching |
| 32768 bytes | standard 32K game, uses F4 (FFF4-FFFA) bankswitching |
| 65536 bytes | Dynacom Megaboy                                      |
| 12288 bytes | RAM+ (FA)                                            |
| 10240 bytes | Pitfall 2 (DPC)                                      |
| 10495 bytes | Pitfall 2 (DPC)                                      |
| 24576 bytes | 24K (FA2)                                            |
| 8448 bytes  | Supercharger single load                             |
| 16896 bytes | Supercharger dual load                               |
| 25344 bytes | Supercharger triple load                             |
| 33792 bytes | Supercharger quad load                               |
| 67584 bytes | Supercharger demo unit                               |

For 8K, 16K, and 32K games, superchip RAM is detected by looking at
the first 256 bytes of the file.  If it is all `0x00` or `0xff` then
the game is assumed to have RAM here.

At this point, the extension is checked.  If it matches one of the
below, then this mapper is selected:

| File extension  | Mapper                            |
| --------------- | ------                            |
| `.ACT`          | Activision 8K FE banking          |
| `.PB`           | Parker Bros. E0 mapping           |
| `.TV`           | Tigervision 3F mapping            |
| `.TVR`          | Tigervision 3E (with RAM) mapping |
| `.MN`           | M-network E7 mapping              |
| `.CV`           | Commavid extra RAM                |
| `.EB`           | Econobanking                      |
| `.EF`           | EF Bankswitching                  |
| `.EFR`          | EF with RAM                       |
| `.UA`           | UA bankswitching                  |
| `.X07`          | X07 bankswitching                 |
| `.SB`           | Superbanking                      |

Note: A popular ROM pack may show certain characters in file names as
flashing characters (i.e. *pele's soccer*).  These show up as flashing
characters in the menu. This is normal because they are outside of the
ASCII range later.

The following changes need to be made to get these games to run:

These need the `.ACT` extension:
- Decathlon
- Robot Tank
- Thwocker

These need the `.PB` extension:
- Frogger II
- Gyruss
- James Bond 007
- Lord of the Rings
- Montezuma's Revenge
- Mr Do's Castle
- Popeye
- Q-bert's Qubes
- Star Wars: Return of the Jedi
- Star Wars: The Arcade Game
- Super Cobra
- Tooth Protectors
- Tutankham

These need the `.TV` extension:
- Espial
- Miner 2049'er
- Miner 2049'er Vol 2
- Polaris
- River patrol
- Springer

These need the `.MN` extension:
- Bump 'n' Jump
- Burgertime
- Masters of the Universe
- Anteater
- Golden SKull
- Treasures of Tarmin

These need the `.CV` extension:
- Magicard
- Video Life

This needs the `.UA` extension:
- Pleiades

Other changes:

*Dig Dug* needs to have the first 256 bytes zeroed out (or set to all
`0xFF`'s) so that the extra RAM can be detected properly.

## Problem solving

**Kool-Aid Man**: uses the left (Player 1) difficulty switch to pause the game (default/disabled position `A` is paused, position `B` is un-paused). Enable this switch in the Core Options menu, or press the right-trigger button on controller 1 to play this game. The right (Player 2) difficulty switch sets the difficulty (default/disabled position `A` is fast/hard, position `B` is normal); this can toggled in the Core Options menu or by pressing the left/right triggers for hard/easy on controller 2. See [game manual](https://archive.org/details/Atari2600Manuals_201812/Kool-Aid%20Man%20%28USA%29) [text](https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=266) for more details.

Some other games that use switches during gameplay: [Ghostbusters](https://archive.org/details/Atari2600Manuals_201812/Ghostbusters%20%28USA%29), [Phaser Patrol](https://archive.org/details/Atari2600Manuals_201812/Phaser%20Patrol%20%28USA%29), [Secret Quest](https://archive.org/details/Atari2600Manuals_201812/Secret%20Quest%20%28USA%29), [Space Shuttle](https://archive.org/details/Atari2600Manuals_201812/Space%20Shuttle%20-%20A%20Journey%20Into%20Space%20%28USA%29), [StarMaster](https://archive.org/details/Atari2600Manuals_201812/StarMaster%20%28USA%29), [Tomcat](https://archive.org/details/Atari2600Manuals_201812/Tomcat%20-%20The%20F-14%20Fighter%20Simulator%20%28USA%29)

# Atari 7800 Core Release Notes

This Atari 7800 core supports official games and pokey sound.  It
currently only supports joysticks and does not run 2600 games. Two
button controllers appear to be working.


## Controller mapping

This core requires the use of a SNES controller if you wish to
manipulate the pause button and difficulty switches.

- `X` is pause on either controller.
- `L` and `R` triggers change the difficulty switch position for the
  respective player.
- `Select` and `Start` are `select` and `reset`, respectively.

The difficulty switches can also be toggled with `Core Options`.


## Mappers and ROMs

Atari 7800 ROMs use headers.  There are a few ROMs with bad headers,
here is how to fix some of them:

- *Commando* has no Pokey sound - the header needs to have it
  enabled. (`0036h` needs to be `03h` instead of `02h`)
- There's a broken version of *Summer Games* and *Winter Games*.  Both
  need address `0036h` changed from `02h` to `06h`.
- There is a broken version of *Sentinel* as well.  Byte `0036h` needs
  to be `02h` instead of `03h`.

This core needs a BIOS to run which you can select with `Core
Options`.  The Core will load the file `7800bios.bin` (expected CRC32:
`5D13730C`) found in the `/BIOS/` directory by default.


----------------------------

# Sega Genesis Jailbreak Notes

The Sega core supports all official Genesis ROMs except for *Virtua
Racing* and does not run 32x ROMs and common unlicensed games.


## Button Mapping

With a NES controller, Button `C` on a Genesis 3-button controller is
mapped to `select`.  Other mappings are as follows:

| Genesis | SNES |
| ------- | ---- |
| `A`     | `B`  |
| `B`     | `Y`  |
| `C`     | `A`  |
| `X`     | `X`  |
| `Y`     | `L`  |
| `Z`     | `R`  |

| Genesis | M30 |
| ------- | --- |
| `A`     | `B` |
| `B`     | `Y` |
| `C`     | `A` |
| `X`     | `X` |
| `Y`     | `Z` |
| `Z`     | `C` |


----------------------

# SMS Core Release Notes

The SMS core runs games released for the Sega Mark III and the Master
System.  This core also runs SG-1000 games but you must use the
Japanese BIOS or no BIOS, however.

You can select a BIOS or disable a BIOS in the `Core Options` menu.
Disabling it all the time may not be ideal because a few games rely on
it running first to set memory (see below for a list).

The BIOS is only loaded when a game is loaded.  To change the BIOS you
must reload the game. If it is missing, loading will fail and it will
return you to the core menu.  Place the BIOS into the `/BIOS/`
directory on the SD card and try again, or turn the BIOS off in the
`Core Options` menu.

The core will load the file with the name `smsbios.bin` by default if
one is found in the `/BIOS/` directory. Note that the Sega Master
System has [many different BIOS
versions](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=search&op=datset&s=26&sel_s=Sega+-+Master+System+-+Mark+III&stext=BIOS&where=1&searchme=Search&pageSel=0&element=Titles&sort=Title&order=Ascending).

You may need to change to an `export` region under `System/Hardware`
to get some games or BIOSes to work.

Because there are three mappers supported, selecting one of the
different mappers works by changing the file extention of the ROM
file.

A ROM that's 48K or less in size is run without a mapper; it is just
loaded straight into `x0000-xBFFF`.

A ROM with a size greater than 48K will use the standard Sega mapper.

Other mappers supported:

`*.SCM` - selects the SMS Codemasters mapper.  The following games require it:
- Cosmic Spacehead
- Dinobasher - Starring Bignose the Caveman (Proto)
- The Excellent Dizzy Collection (Proto)
- Fantastic Dizzy
- Micro Machines

`*.SKR` - select the SMS Korean mapper.  The following games require it:
- Dallyeora Pigu Wang (Korea) (Unl)
- Jang Pung II (Korea) (Unl)
- Jang Pung 3 (Korea) (Unl)
- Samgukji 3 (Korea) (Unl)

Any other extention is valid, and will just load as either no mapper
or the standard Sega one.

The system will properly run larger, bankswitched BIOS ROMs such as
the combined BIOS+Hang On, etc. ROMs.

Some ROMs have a useless 512 byte header at the beginning that is
mostly `x00`'s. If this is found, it is ignored.

Some versions of the system have a `game reset` button.  You may
activate this feature by pressing `select` and `X` at the same time on
a SNES controller.  That is a safeguard to prevent it accidentally
being pressed and resetting the game.

Pause is mapped to the `start` button like you'd expect.

Lastly, you can turn the YM2413 on and off.  This is because a couple
games crash if it's on.


## Problems and how to solve them

**SG-1000**: Unselect `Use BIOS` for playing these games or select the
Japanese BIOS.  Also, select Japan as the Region in `System/Hardware`.

*Terebi Oekaki*: needs a drawing tablet and will not start without it.

**SMS**: You may need to pivot between the US and Japanese BIOSes for
certain games to work.  The US BIOS performs a region check and will
not play games (such as Sega's Japanese games) that do not pass the
check.

- PAL games might have problems such as sprite flicker; this is normal
  and happens on an NTSC system too.
- Some games (*Walter Payton Football*, *Spy vs. Spy*) need the US
  BIOS to work.  The former runs but has initial title screen
  corruption and the latter doesn't start at all.
- MSX Ports larger than 48K use unusual mappers and are not supported.
- Games that require a paddle controller, light gun or the 3-D glasses
  will not work.
- *Wanted* - you must turn off FM for this game to work but it still
  requires a light gun
- *Super Tank* - select one of the `export` options in
  `System/Hardware`.
- *Back to the Future 3* - locks up at black screen because it detects
  PAL/NTSC and will refuse to work if it detects NTSC


----------------------------

# Game Gear Core Release Notes

Early models of Game Gear did not include a BIOS, but later ones did.
If you wish to see that blue startup screen, you can by selecting the
BIOS file under `core options`.  The core will load a file with the
name `ggbios.bin` (expected CRC32: `0EBEA9D4`) by default if found in
the `/BIOS/` directory.

Because there are three mappers, selecting one of the different
mappers works by changing the file extention of the ROM file.

A ROM that's 48K or less in size is run without a mapper; it is just
loaded straight into `x0000-xBFFF`.

A ROM greater than this size will use the standard Sega mapper.

Other mappers supported:
- `*.GCM` - selects the SMS Codemasters mappers
- `*.GKR` - selects the SMS Korean mapper.

Any other extention is valid, and will just load as either no mapper
or the standard Sega one.


## Problems and how to solve them

These games are not actually Game Gear games but were released on the
system and operate in SMS mode. You can play them on the SMS core:

- Castle of Illusion - Starring Mickey Mouse
- Cave Dude (Proto)
- Chase H.Q.
- The Excellent Dizzy Collection
- Fantastic Dizzy
- Jang Pung II/Street Battle (Unl)
- Olympic Gold
- Out Run Europa
- Predator 2
- Prince of Persia
- Rastan Saga
- R.C. Grand Prix
- Street Hero (Unl)
- Super Kick Off
- Super Tetris (Unl)
- WWF WrestleMania Steel Cage Challenge

These games need the .GCM file extension:

- CJ Elephant Fugitive
- Cosmic Spacehead
- (Archer MacLean's) Dropzone
- Ernie Els Golf
- The Excellent Dizzy Collection
- Fantastic Dizzy
- (S.S. Lucifer) Man Overboard!
- Micro Machines
- Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament
- Pete Sampras Tennis

The Core will not play any games that use EEPROM for saving properly
at this time, they will refuse to load.  The following games are the
only known games to use EEPROM:

- Hyper Pro Yakyuu '92
- Majors Pro Baseball, The
- Pro Yakyuu GG League
- World Series Baseball
- World Series Baseball '95 (including prototypes)

# Colecovision Core Release Notes

The Coleco core will run games designed for the unenhanced
ColecoVision as well as Super Game Module games.

Loading a BIOS is required for this Core to load ROMs.  Load a BIOS
under the `core options` menu.  The Core will automatically load a
file named `colbios.bin` if found in the `/BIOS/` directory, but you
can use the Select New BIOS File option to select a BIOS file with any
name.

| Coleco BIOS CRC32 | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | -----------                                 |
| `3AA93EF3`        | Official                                    |
| `39BB16FC`        | Unofficial, stylized font, can skip waiting |
| `4999ABC6`        | Bit Corp clone                              |


## Button mapping

A SNES Controller (or any compatible 12-button controller) or SNES NTT
Data Pad (NDK10) is ideal for this core.  The NTT Data Pad's numberpad
is directly mapped the Coleco controller's numberpad.  ~~Same for the
Famicom Network Controller (HVC-051).~~

If using a standard SNES Controller, this is how the Coleco numberpad
maps to the SNES buttons:

| SNES Button/Combo   | Assignment                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------                                                     |
| `Start`             | `1` (this usually selects the easiest game difficulty)         |
| `Select`            | `3` (this usually selects a harder game)                       |
| `X`                 | `#` (a popular option for some games to use as a start button) |
| `A`                 | `*` (another popular option to start games)                    |
| `L` + `up`          | `0`                                                            |
| `L` + `right`       | `1`                                                            |
| `L` + `down`        | `2`                                                            |
| `L` + `left`        | `3`                                                            |
| `R` + `up`          | `4`                                                            |
| `R` + `right`       | `5`                                                            |
| `R` + `down`        | `6`                                                            |
| `R` + `left`        | `7`                                                            |
| `L` + `R` + `up`    | `8`                                                            |
| `L` + `R` + `right` | `9`                                                            |


## Special ROM handling

Two reproduction games, *The Black Onyx* and *Boxxle* use EEPROM for
saving, 256 bytes and 32KB, respectively.  Rename their extensions to
`.ce0` and `.ce1`, respectively to get them working.  A third
reproduction game, *Gradius*, saves to flash memory and uses a custom
mapper.  Rename its extension to `.cf0` to get it working.


--------------------------

# Gameboy Core Release Notes

The Gameboy core supports games using MBC1, MBC2, MBC3 (except RTC
saving) and MBC5 (except rumble).  You must select the Gameboy's
bootstrap (BIOS) for it to work.  `dmgbios.bin` (expected CRC32:
`59C8598E`) is the default file to be loaded if found in the `/BIOS/`
directory.  The Super Gameboy bootstrap `dmgbios2.bin` (example CRC32:
`EC8A83B9`) also seems to work and skips the scrolling intro.


---------------------------------

# Gameboy Color Core Release Notes

The Gameboy Color core supports games using MBC1, MBC2, MBC3 (except
RTC saving) and MBC5 (except rumble).  You must select the Gameboy
Color's bootstrap (BIOS) for it to work.  `gbcbios.bin` (expected
CRC32: `41884E46`) is the default file to be loaded if found in the
`/BIOS/` directory.


--------------------------------

# Intellivision Core Release Notes

The Intellivision core supports games for the base system, the
Intellivoice speech attachment and to some extent, the Enhanced
Computer System addon (ECS).

You will need the GROM binary `grom.bin` placed in the `/BIOS/` directory (expected CRC32: `683A4158`).

You will need an Executive BIOS file (in INTV2 format) for Intellivision (expected default name: `intvexec1.bin`).
This file can be selected by name in the core menu.
The recommended BIOS to convert and use is `Executive ROM, The (1978) (Mattel).int`, aka `intv/exec.bin` from MAME, with CRC32: `CBCE86F7`, 8192 bytes.
When converted to the INTV2 format to be used with the Nt Mini Noir, it is 8208 bytes with CRC32: `EEB54C63`. This converted file should be placed in the `/BIOS/` directory with the expected name `intvexec1.bin`. See further below for information on the INTV2 format.

Note: You may also use the *Intellivision II* Executive BIOS (INTV2 format expected CRC32: `A85FC6DD`, 8728 bytes), but it may be incompatible with some games (e.g. *Carnival*, *Donkey Kong*, *Mouse Trap*, *Venture*). This particular rom can be found in [MAME](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/drivers/intv.cpp) (`intv/intv2/ro-3-9506-010.ic6`, 8704 bytes, CRC32: `DD7E1237`). The first 512 bytes are mapped to address 0x400, the remaining 8192 bytes are mapped to address 0x1000. To convert this file to INTV2 format, each of the two chunks need an eight-byte INTV2 header, with an INTV2 file trailer:
`00 04 00 00 00 01 00 00`
*(first 512 bytes of rom)*
`00 10 00 00 00 10 00 00`
*(remaining 8K bytes of rom)*
`00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`


To use the Intellivoice, the 2K ROM for the speech chip has to be
present in the `/BIOS/` directory and named `012.bin`.

`012.bin` can be constructed by reversing the _bit_ order for each byte in `sp0256-012.bin` (CRC32: `0DE7579D`) from the `intv_voice` entry in MAME.


## Controller support

Only the SNES NTT Data Pad (NDK10) ~~or the Famicom Network Controller
(HVC-051)~~ can fully map the numberpads of the Intellivision
controller.

By default, the controller plugged into port two on the console will
likely be seen as player one by the game, so the `Core Options` menu
allows you to swap controllers.  It also allows you to enable ECS,
Intellivoice and Intellicart mapping.


## INTV2 ROM Format

Because Intv games map themselves into various areas of memory, the
ROM must be able to tell the Core into which areas of memory address
space game code and data are to be loaded.  There is more than one
existing format for Intellivision ROMs.

The existing Intellivision ROM conventions were deemed unsuitable to
the Intellivision Core.  To make something usable, a new file format
was created called INTV2.  It has the extension `.intv` and the Core
will only load Intellivision ROMs in this format.

The files are a relatively simple format.  All data is stored in
little endian form, with the lowest 8 bits first and the upper 2 bits
(for decles) stored next with the top 6 bits `0`'s.  This format
allows the storage of 16 bit words too, since some homebrews use these
instead.  It is also stored in little endian format.

Since the ROMs self-map into memory, some provision to define where
data goes is needed, thus a chunked format was devised.

Each file consists of 1 or more chunks, which define the start address
in memory where the data is to be loaded, and its length followed by
the actual data.  The last chunk is simply an address and length of 0.

All address and length values are little endian.  Each field is 32
bits.  The first 64K of the address space is the Intellivision's
memory map directly.  Each address is a word address, so `0x5000` is
word address `0x5000` (which would technically be byte `0xa000` on a
modern system).

Here's an example using *Burgertime*.  It is a 16K game (8K words).
It maps into memory at `0x5000`, and has a length of `0x2000` (words).
It is constructed as so:

```
/ address \ /  length \     ROM data          / address \ /  length \
00 50 00 00 00 20 00 00 <16K of data follows> 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

Bit 16 of the address right now selects if this area is writeable or
not (i.e. RAM).  The other bits may be used in the future for
bankswitched games and/or homebrews as they arise.

The BIOS you wish to use also needs to be in this format, since the
different BIOSes (i.e. intv2) load data in different places.

A utility to convert files to the INTV2 format can be found [here](https://github.com/dot-bob/int2intv).

----------------------------------

# Adventurevision Core Release Notes

The Adventurevision core runs all games.  The Code Red demo does not
run as well as the games because it does not use BIOS routines for
graphics drawing.

There are two BIOS files needed for this core:

| File          | Description                                                               |
| ------------- | -----------                                                               |
| `avbios.bin`  | This is the 1K ROM found inside the 8048 on the system. CRC32: `279E33D1` |
| `avsound.bin` | This is the 512 byte ROM on the sound CPU. CRC32: `81E95975`              |

Both of these need to be put in the `/BIOS/` directory and named as
identified above.

*Turtles* seems to have a graphical "bug" on it, the right size of the
maze is shifted right by a pixel, but this is how the real system runs
it.

*Defender* likewise has a bad collision bug on original hardware, you
can often shoot through enemies, this appears to occur due to the game
checking only when your shots touch the edge of an enemy sprite.


-------------------------------

# Arcadia 2001 Core Release Notes

The Aradia 2001 core runs known 2001 games, but there are other
systems based on the same/similar chips.  Games for these systems may
or may not run on this core.

Several prototypes of released games have graphics issues that the
released versions fixed.

Some homebrews games rely on the numberpad rather than the joystick to
move.


## Controls

You can use the keypad of an SNES NTT Data Pad (NDK10) or press
"chords" on a SNES controller.  The "chording" works similar to the
Colecovision:

```
Ltrig + up = 0
Ltrig + right = 1
Ltrig + down = 2
Ltrig + left = 3

Rtrig + up = 4
Rtrig + right = 5
Rtrig + down = 6
Rtrig + left = 7

Ltrig + Rtrig + up = 8
Ltrig + Rtrig + right = 9
Ltrig + Rtrig + down = *
```
These buttons don't require chording:
```
X = #
A = option (both controllers)
start = start (both controllers)
select = select (both controllers)
Y = fire button
```


----------------------------

# Channel F Core Release Notes

The Channel F BIOS is required to be present in the `/BIOS/` directory
and it must be named `cfbios.bin` (expected CRC32: `2882C02D`).

The BIOS should be a concatenation of:
- `[BIOS] Fairchild Channel F (USA) (SL31253).bin` (CRC32: `04694ED9`),
- `[BIOS] Fairchild Channel F (USA) (SL31254).bin` (CRC32: `9C047BA3`)

resulting in a merged file with a CRC32 checksum of `2882C02D`.

For example, via Windows command-line:
```
copy /B sl31253.bin + sl31254.bin cfbios.bin
```


## Button mapping

There are four buttons on the Channel F system to select a game, time
length, and other things. Starting a game involves optionally setting
these to start playing.

On this core, the mapping of these four buttons is as such to a SNES
controller:

```
1 - left trigger
2 - right trigger
3 - select
4 - start
```

If you have an SNES NTT Data Pad (NDK10), `1, 2, 3, 4` map to `1, 2,
3, 4` on the NTT Data Pad's numeric keypad.

Using it:

When the system is reset, it says `G?` on the screen.  It is asking
which game to play.  Hitting one of the four buttons results in
selecting one of the 4 games on the cartridge.

```
 (left trigger) 1 - "game 1" (from the cart, or the BIOS if "play bios games" file is run)
(right trigger) 2 - "game 1" (from the cart, or the BIOS if "play bios games" file is run)
       (select) 3 - "game 3" (from the cart)
        (start) 4 - "game 4" (from the cart)
```

Next, it will print `S?` on the screen.  You can either start a game
now or enter more options.  These options are:

```
 (left trigger) 1 - time limit
(right trigger) 2 - game speed/(mode or motion)
        (start) 4 - start game immediately
```

If you press `1` for a time limit, then `T?` is displayed.  You can
choose a time limit using the four buttons:

```
 (left trigger) 1 - 2 minutes
(right trigger) 2 - 5 minutes
       (select) 3 - 10 minutes
        (start) 4 - 20 minutes
```

At this time, you can press either `1`, `2`, or `4` since it should be
back at the S? prompt.

If you had pressed `2` for a mode (motion / speed) `M?` will be
displayed.  Generally, 1-4 will be the speed of the game from slow to
fast.

```
 (left trigger) 1 - speed 1
(right trigger) 2 - speed 2
       (select) 3 - speed 3
        (start) 4 - speed 4
```
As with the time setting, it should be back at the `S?` prompt, ready for the next option.

For general-variety playing, you can simply load a game and hit
`ltrig`/`rtrig`/`select`/`start` then `start` to start one of the 4
games.

It seems many games choose one controller port at random to use for
player 1 (i.e. some games use controller port 1, some use controller
port 2) so if a game does not seem playable, add a second controller
or swap ports.


-------------------------------

# Creativision Core Release Notes

You must press `reset` after loading a game on this system to play it.

The Creativision plays games and supports the keyboard but tape saving
and loading are not working.

The Creativision BIOS must be present in the `/BIOS/` directory and
named `crbios.bin`, expected CRC32: `05602697`


## Button mapping

Even though there is no support for a physical keyboard, the games are
still playable using a regular controller.

The `B` and `A` buttons are mapped to the two fire buttons, and
`start`/`select` are mapped to the two most common buttons used to
start the games.

On startup, most games will run, show a demo mode and even appear to
respond to controller input.  To get out of demo mode, you must reset
the system.


-------------------------

# Gamate Core Release Notes

This core needs a BIOS, and there's two known BIOSes: a Bit Corp
version (CRC32: `07090415`) and a UMC version (CRC32:
`03A5F3A7`). Either can be used, but it must be named `gmbios.bin` and
placed in the `/BIOS/` directory on your SD card.

There are three mappers on the system, and two of these can be
distinguished by file size, however the multicart(s) need the `.GML`
extension.  So rename the file from i.e. `4-in-1.bin` to `4-in-1.gml`
to run it.


-------------------------

# Game King Core Release Notes

This core needs a BIOS.  It should be named `gkbios.bin` (sometimes it
can be found named `gm218.bin`) and place it in the `/BIOS/` directory
on your SD card. Expected CRC32: `5A1ADE3D`.

There's three built in games to the system, so if you wish to play
these, simply run the included file, `play bios games.bin`.  This is
an empty file consisting of nothing but bytes of `0xff`.  This
simulates having no cartridge in the system.


----------------------------

# Odyssey<sup>2</sup> Core Release Notes

The Odyssey<sup>2</sup> core supports keyboards via PS2 and an adapter that
plugs into the Famicom expansion port.  If you wish to make an
adapter, you can find the schematic in the `/SYSTEM/` directory.

The Voice speech expansion add-on is also complete and fully
functional if you wish to hear speech/sound effects in the games that
support it.

Some games (such as *Frogger*) play poorly with The Voice being
enabled all the time, but most games will work fine with it enabled.
On *Frogger* it will constantly repeat an allophone over and over.
This is not a bug but a byproduct of how The Voice works.

This core needs a BIOS.  It should be named:

```
o2bios.bin    - Main 8048 BIOS (1K byte)  CRC32: 8016A315
```

This BIOS file can be selected with `Core Options`. If you wish to use
the voice, you need three files:

```
019.bin       - Speech ROM in the SP0256-019 speech chip (2K bytes)  CRC32: 19355075
sp128_03.bin  - Speech ROM resident in the speech module (16K bytes) CRC32: 66041B03
sp128_04.bin  - Speech ROM in Sid the Spellbinder (16K bytes)        CRC32: 6780C7D3
```

`019.bin` can be constructed by reversing the _bit_ order for each byte in `sp0256b-019.bin` (CRC32: 4BB43724) from the `o2_voice` entry in MAME.

Place them in the `/BIOS/` directory and name them as indicated above.

The controller maps the directionals directly to the Odyssey<sup>2</sup>
directions as you'd expect.  On a SNES controller the mapping is as
follows :

```
Y is the fire button
start is "1" on the keyboard
select is "2" on the keyboard
A is "3" on the keyboard
X is "4" on the keyboard
Ltrig is "enter" on the keyboard
Rtrig is "clear" on the keyboard
```

Note that some games swap the two controllers from the majority of
games, so player 2 is actually the controller to use for single player
games.

Keyboard mapping:

If you make or buy the PS2 adapter and use a PS2 keyboard you can use
it directly to simulate the Odyssey<sup>2</sup> keyboard.

All Odyssey<sup>2</sup> keys map to their corresponding keys on a PC keyboard
except "clear" which is mapped to backspace.

Most games can be played without the keyboard, due to the mapping of
1-4 from the keyboard which are usually used to start games.  Some
games like *Killer Bees* start using the fire button.


-------------------------------

# RCA Studio 2 Core Release Notes

The Studio 2 core runs games and homebrew.

The video display can be problematic on this Core, showing the following issues:

- The selected entry on the menus flashes really fast.
- The screen might scroll on reset.
- You cannot see the menu on composite/rgb if the CPU is reset.

These problems are related to how the system renders video, the CPU
itself drives the video display, and when the CPU does not run, it
does not generate video timing.

Many games on this system them start with a black screen until you
press a button.  This is normal, refer to the instruction manual to
determine how to start the game.

This system requires a BIOS, and it must be named `rca2bios.bin`
(CRC32: `A494B339`) and placed in the `/BIOS/` directory.

The BIOS should be a concatenation of:
- `84932.ic11` (CRC32: `283B7E65`),
- `84933.ic12` (CRC32: `A396B77C`),
- `85456.ic13` (CRC32: `D25CF97F`),
- `85457.ic14` (CRC32: `74AA724F`)

from the `studio2` entry in MAME, resulting in a merged file with a CRC32 checksum of `A494B339`.

For example, via Windows command-line:
```
copy /B 84932.ic11 + 84933.ic12 + 85456.ic13 + 85457.ic14 rca2bios.bin
```

## Controller mapping

The system has two 10 key keypads.  These are almost always used as a
"joystick".  Here is how it maps to a SNES Controller :

| RCA Studio 2 keypad | SNES Controller |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| `1`                 | `up`+`left`     |
| `2`                 | `up`            |
| `3`                 | `up`+`right`    |
| `4`                 | `left`          |
| `5`                 | `Y`             |
| `6`                 | `right`         |
| `7`                 | `down`+`left`   |
| `8`                 | `down`          |
| `9`                 | `down`+`right`  |
| `0`                 | `B`             |

You can hold down `A` which will disable the D-pad on the controller
so you can easily press `1`, `3`, `9`, or `7` (the diagonals) without
hitting one of the cardinal directions.

If you have an SNES NTT Data Pad (NDK10), you can use its numberpad to
hit `0`-`9`.

This core uses a monochrome menu.  This is normal.

Note: When the system is first started and a game is loaded, it's
overwritten by the BIOS games, so the first games that will play are
the BIOS games.  Loading another game or the same one again will cause
it to load the game as desired.


------------------------------

# Supervision Core Release Notes

The Supervision core plays all games and does not require a BIOS.

*sssnake* appears to output a very quiet sound when you pick something
up, but this is a bug in the program.  The game is playing one of the
drum samples really slowly so it doesn't make much sound.


-----------------------------

# Videobrain Core Release Notes

The Videobrain supports keyboards via a PS2 keyboard and the Odyssey<sup>2</sup>
adapter.

This core needs a pair BIOS ROMs. They must be named:

```
uvres1.bin    - The first BIOS file (2K bytes)  CRC32: `065FE7C2` (commonly named "uvres 1n.d67" in the vidbrain entry in MAME)
uvres2.bin    - The second BIOS file (2K bytes) CRC32: `1D85D7BE` (commonly named "resn2.e5" in the vidbrain entry in MAME)
```

Place them in the `/BIOS/` directory.

Controller mapping:

The controller maps the directionals directly to the Videobrain's
directionals

`B` is the fire button


## Keyboard mapping

If you use the PS2 adapter and keyboard, the PC keyboard maps as
follows:

`A`-`Z` maps to `A`-`Z`

Capslock is the `shift` key because the Capslock function is
controlled by the system.  The state of shift is indicated on screen
with a box at the bottom right.  If it's black, it's unshifted and
`A`-`Z` works like usual.  If it's grey, shift is on and symbols and
numbers are usable.  The mapping of the keyboard when shifted and
unshifted is as follows:

Non-shifted characters:
```
A-Z, 0, space
```
Shifted characters:
```
1-9, !, #, $, %, *, (, ), -, +, =, ., ', ", ?
F9  - cent symbol
F10 - pi symbol
F11 - division symbol
F12 - multiplication symbol
```

These characters and symbols are "dual mapped", because shift/nonshift
is not known by the keyboard, due to the shift being handled in the
VideoBrain itself, so if you are unshifted and press `%`, `Q` will
print to the screen.  Likewise if it is shifted and `Q` is pressed,
`%` will appear.

```
F1 - restart/erase
F2 - run/stop
F3 - alarm/special
F4 - clock/next
F5 - color/previous
F6 - text/back
```

## Playing the games

Many of the games need the keyboard to start them. There is an empty
binary file that lets you use the built in BIOS functions.

# Megaduck Release Notes

Megaduck has no BIOS but it does have mappers.


## Special ROM handling

There are two different mappers for Megaduck.  They are selected by
extension.  `.MD1` selects the single 32K selectable bank mode, and
`.MD2` selects the 16K selectable bank mode.

All games greater than 32K need the `.MD2` extension except for the
following two games:
- *Puppet Knight*
- *Suleiman's Treasure*

These need the `.MD1` extension.  32K games do not need a special
extension.
